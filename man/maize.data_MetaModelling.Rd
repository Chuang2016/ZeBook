\description{
Simulation data for several site and year (site-year) in Europe.
This data are from run of the original maize crop model with the R function maize.model for the
30 French sites and 17 years included in the dataset weather_FranceWest of the package ZeBook.
Our training dataset includes 510 (30 sites * 17 years) simulated biomass values and the 510 corresponding series of input values.
The input values are the three average temperatures T1, T2, T3 and
the three average radiations RAD1, RAD2, RAD3 computed on 3 periods of the growing season.
Period 1 : from day 1 to dat 50 (day of the year), period 2: from day 51 to day 100, period 3 : from day 101 to day 150.
