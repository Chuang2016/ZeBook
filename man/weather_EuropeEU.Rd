  This contemporary daily climate dataset for Europe covers
  the period 1st January 2001 to 31 December 2010 with 10
  complete years of data. It cover a part of Europe) with
  an elevation less than 500m. The dataset was was extrated
  from the NASA Langley Research Center POWER Project which
  provide agroclimatology dataset (Chandler et al., 2004).
  It was funded through the NASA Earth Science Directorate
  Applied Science Program This climate datasetcontains
  daily estimates of precipitation, mean, minimum and
  maximum temperature, relative humidity, dew point, solar
  radiation and wind speed with global coverage at one
  degree resolution (approximately 111 km at the equator).
  The NASA POWER agroclimatology data are derived from
  various sources: solar radiation from satellite
  observations, meteorological data from the Goddard Earth
  Observing System global assimilation model version 4
  (GEOS-4), and precipitation from the Global Precipitation
  Climate Project and Topical Rainfall Measurement Mission.

  Elevation (Altitude) were retrive from Aster Global
  Digital Elevation Model by using the Webservice
  api.geonames.org/astergdem? Sample are: ca 30m x 30m,
  between 83N and 65S latitude. Result : a single number
  giving the elevation in meters according to aster gdem,
  ocean areas have been masked as "no data" and have been
  assigned a value of -9999 Example
