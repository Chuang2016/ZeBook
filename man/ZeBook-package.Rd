Working with dynamic models for agriculture and environment
(Working with Dynamic Crop Models)

Linked to book \strong{Working with Dynamic Crop Models} (Elsevier), Third edition, in preparation for April 2018 by Wallach, Makowski, Jones and Brun)

A full description of the models is in the book in appendix of the book.

Chapter numbers have changed between Second edition and Third Edition. Here the chapter numbers in the demo were changed to fit to Third edition. But all materials available in Second edition are still available in this version. 

\strong{ACKNOWLEDGMENTS}
The project "Associate a level of error in predictions of models for agronomy" (CASDAR 2010-2013) and the French network "RMT modeling and agriculture", \url{http://www.modelia.org}) have contributed to the development of this R package. This project and network are lead by ACTA (French Technical Institute for Agriculture) and was funded by a grant from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fishing of France.
