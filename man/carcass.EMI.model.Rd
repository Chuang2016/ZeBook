\description{
\strong{Model description.}
This model is proposed by Hoch et. al (2004) to represent the growth of cattle and the relative body composition of diferent types of animals depending on nuritionnal conditions.
It simulates the dynamics of changes in the composition of the body fat and proteins according to nutrient intake. The system is represented by four state variables: the protein and fat in the carcass (resp. ProtC and LIPC) and other tissues (resp. ProtNC and LipNC) grouped under the name of the fifth district (again, gastrointestinal tract, skin .. .). These variables depend on time, the time step used is dt = 1 day.
The model is defined by 20 equations, with a total of 18 parameters for the described process.
