\description{
  The SeedWeight model is a logistic model of grain weight
  over time in wheat. The model was proposed by Darroch &
  Baker (1990) in a study of grain filling in three spring
  wheat genotypes.  This model has a single input variable,
  degree days after anthesis noted DD, and three
  parameters, noted W, B and C. Parameters are estimated
  from observations.
